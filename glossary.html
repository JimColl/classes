<p>I’m not usually one to play the semantics game or argue over for the strict application of language and terminology, that ends up far too often being an exercise in us trying to define words.

<p><strong>Hydrology</strong> is the study of the cycling of the mass of water across the landscape, <strong>hydraulics</strong> is the study of how we can transform the instantaneous state of that cycle into an elevation, and <strong>flood inundation mapping</strong> is the act of placing geographic context on those calculations.</p>

Zone AR
</td>
<td style="text-align:right;">
</td>
<td style="text-align:right;">
Zone AR is the flood insurance rate zone used to depict areas protected from flood hazards by flood control structures, such as a levee, that are being restored. FEMA will consider using the Zone AR designation for a community if the flood protection system has been deemed restorable by a Federal agency in consultation with a local project sponsor; a minimum level of flood protection is still provided to the community by the system; and restoration of the flood protection system is scheduled to begin within a designated time period and in accordance with a progress plan negotiated between the community and FEMA. Mandatory purchase requirements for flood insurance will apply in Zone AR, but the rate will not exceed the rate for unnumbered A zones if the structure is built in compliance with Zone AR floodplain management regulations. For floodplain management in Zone AR areas, elevation is not required for improvements to existing structures. However, for new construction, the structure must be elevated (or floodproofed for non-residential structures) such that the lowest floor, including basement, is a maximum of 3 feet above the highest adjacent existing grade if the depth of the base flood elevation (BFE) does not exceed 5 feet at the proposed development site. For infill sites, rehabilitation of existing structures, or redevelopment of previously developed areas, there is a 3 foot elevation requirement regardless of the depth of the BFE at the project site. The Zone AR designation will be removed and the restored flood control system shown as providing protection from the 1% annual chance flood on the NFIP map upon completion of the restoration project and submittal of all the necessary data to FEMA.

A standard format, structure, and organization, used by National Imagery and Mapping Agency, for large geographic databases that are based on a georelational data model and are intended for direct use. VPF is designed to be compatible with a wide variety of applications and products. VPF uses tables and indexes that permit direct access by spatial location and thematic content and is designed to be used with any digital geographic data in vector format that can be represented using nodes, edges, and faces. VPF defines the format of data objects, and the georelational data model provides a data organization within which software can manipulate the VPF data objects.

Particles often appear visibly rounded.","The sedimentary deposit located at a topographic break, such as the base of a mountain front, escarpment, or valley side, that is composed of streamflow and/or debris flow sediments and has the shape of a fan, either fully or partially extended. These characteristics can be categorized by composition, morphology, and location.","The flooding that occurs on an alluvial fan as defined above. The term alluvial fan flooding encompasses both active alluvial fan flooding and inactive alluvial fan flooding.","Flooding that occurs only on alluvial fans and is characterized by flow path uncertainty so great that this uncertainty cannot be set aside in realistic assessments of flood risk or in the reliable mitigation of the hazard. An active alluvial fan flooding hazard is indicated by three related criteria: (1) flow path uncertainty below the hydrographic apex; (2) abrupt deposition and ensuing erosion of sediment as a stream or debris flow loses its ability to carry material eroded from a steeper, upstream source area; and (3) an environment where the combination of sediment availability, slope, and topography creates an ultrahazardous condition for which elevation on fill will not reliably mitigate the risk.","Flooding that is similar to traditional riverine flood hazards, but occurs only on alluvial fans. Inactive alluvial fan flooding is characterized by flow paths with a higher degree of certainty in realistic assessments of flood risk or in the reliable mitigation of the hazard. Unlike active alluvial fan flooding hazards, an inactive alluvial fan flooding hazard is characterized by relatively stable flow paths. However, like areas of active alluvial fan flooding, inactive alluvial fan flooding, may be subject to sediment deposition and erosion, but to a degree that does not cause flow path instability and uncertainty.","Data consisting of both letters and numbers, and possibly symbols such as punctuation marks.","The formal objection to proposed or proposed modified Base Flood Elevations (BFEs), submitted by a community official or an owner or lessee of real property within the community during the statutory 90-day appeal period.

All accepted models must meet the requirements set forth in Subparagraph 65.6(a)(6) of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations.","A flood hazard study that results in the delineation of floodplain boundaries for the 1-percent-annual-chance (100-year) flood, but does not include the determination of BFEs or flood depths.","The level of spatial measurement referring to a two-dimensional defined space","The various layers prepared by the cartographic staff that are components of the manually produced Flood Insurance Rate Map and/or Flood Boundary and Floodway Map.","A term used to describe mapping and mapping-related data that reflect conditions within a floodplain based on flood-control and other structures being completed.","The descriptive characteristic or quality of a feature.

Mandatory purchase requirements for flood insurance will apply in Zone AR, but the rate will not exceed the rate for unnumbered A zones if the structure is built in compliance with Zone AR floodplain management regulations. For floodplain management in Zone AR areas, elevation is not required for improvements to existing structures. However, for new construction, the structure must be elevated (or floodproofed for non-residential structures) such that the lowest floor, including basement, is a maximum of 3 feet above the highest adjacent existing grade if the depth of the base flood elevation (BFE) does not exceed 5 feet at the proposed development site. For infill sites, rehabilitation of existing structures, or redevelopment of previously developed areas, there is a 3 foot elevation requirement regardless of the depth of the BFE at the project site.

The term alluvial fan flooding encompasses both active alluvial fan flooding and inactive alluvial fan flooding.","Flooding that occurs only on alluvial fans and is characterized by flow path uncertainty so great that this uncertainty cannot be set aside in realistic assessments of flood risk or in the reliable mitigation of the hazard. An active alluvial fan flooding hazard is indicated by three related criteria: (1) flow path uncertainty below the hydrographic apex; (2) abrupt deposition and ensuing erosion of sediment as a stream or debris flow loses its ability to carry material eroded from a steeper, upstream source area; and (3) an environment where the combination of sediment availability, slope, and topography creates an ultrahazardous condition for which elevation on fill will not reliably mitigate the risk.","Flooding that is similar to traditional riverine flood hazards, but occurs only on alluvial fans. Inactive alluvial fan flooding is characterized by flow paths with a higher degree of certainty in realistic assessments of flood risk or in the reliable mitigation of the hazard. Unlike active alluvial fan flooding hazards, an inactive alluvial fan flooding hazard is characterized by relatively stable flow paths. However, like areas of active alluvial fan flooding, inactive alluvial fan flooding, may be subject to sediment deposition and erosion, but to a degree that does not cause flow path instability and uncertainty.","Data consisting of both letters and numbers, and possibly symbols such as punctuation marks.","The formal objection to proposed or proposed modified Base Flood Elevations (BFEs), submitted by a community official or an owner or lessee of real property within the community during the statutory 90-day appeal period.
